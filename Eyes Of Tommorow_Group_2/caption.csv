image2,Doctor Finch picks the call and an AI generated voice gives him a twelve digit number that he notes down on a  paper,20
image3,It also gives date and time. And then gets disconnected abruptly.,20
image4,"Finch reaches his hideout, with a sense of confusion on what the twelve digit number means.",20
image5,"Finch sticks the number to his board, where there are several other twelve digit numbers with past dates.",20
image6,Finch is perplexed and thinks how to decode what the number means.,20
image7,He runs several complex algorthims such as pattern matching but fails to resolve decode the twelve digit number.,20
image8,FLASHBACK: Finch is the chief scientist of project EYES where he is designated to build a machine.,20
image9,"With all his expertise, he builds a complex algorithm to detect the terror attacks globally with the help of AI technology to forsee the future.",20
image10,!!!!!,20
image11,Finch calls government Authorities to inform about the MACHINE,20
image12,"Ethan Hunt, the Chief Defense Oficer of US Govt congratutales Dr.Finch for succesfully building project EYES.",20
image13,"Dr. Finch: Officer Hunt, but I found an issue with the machine's result. ",20
image14,"Dr. Finch: If you can see this result, the AI was primarily built to forsee terror attacks but starts to identify the violence among common people.",20
image15,Ethan :  The sole purpose of the AI is to meet the needs of the government not that of every individual. We cannot stop every violence and thats not our concern.,20
image16,"Ethan: Mark those data as ""IRRELEVANT"" 
Dr. Finch: But we are letting down the people who has every right to access this technology.",20
image17,"Dr. Finch: Kindly let me help to stop these violent events
Ethan: Sorry Finch that is not your decision to make. Our contract ends here. ",20
image18,Dr. Finch: This is not fair. Please don't leave,20
image19,Dr. Finch is dissapointed with the decision of Ethan.,20
image20,Ethan calls his PA and schedules to remove the AI access to Scientist and move it to a safe place.,20
image21,Dr. Finch designs a backdoor code to access the so called Irrelevant data,20
image22,The backdoor code is successfully generated after a series of attempts,20
image23,!!!!!,20
image24,The AI chooses the safest way to contact Dr.Finch is through a public telephone recognizing Dr.Finch location by acccessing public camers,20
image25,Dr.Finch gets the message to follow Michael King,20
image26,Dr.Finch searches the database and finds Michael King who is a ghost from the government radar,20
image27,Dr.Finch follows King,20
image28,King finds out he is being followed and nabs Dr.Finch to find out the reason,20
image29,King takes Dr.Finch to a EX-CIA blacksite and locks him up,20
image30,King threatens Dr.Finch to spill out the truth,20
image31,"King: To which agency do you belong to and How much did they pay you? Dr.Finch: Take it easy, I can explain you. Take a look at my ID.",20
image32,!!!!!,20
image33,Dr.Finch: You all must have known project EYES as a theoritical concept. But it does exist and I am the one who built it.,20
image34,Dr.Finch: But now the government has taken control of it and I am left clueless.,20
image35,Dr.Finch: I was invited by CIA to lead one of the most secretive mission of US history.,20
image36,Dr.Finch: We worked in area 53 which cannot be accessed even to military officals like you.,20
image37,Dr.Finch: Our goal was to build a sophisticated AI machine which can watch the Global Terror attacks before they could happen.,20
image38,Dr.Finch: We leveraged the mordern technology to access everything that is connected to the internet.,20
image39,Dr.Finch: We have built a super AI which evolves by itself based on the decisions it takes and its outcome. But the government decided not to use it for saving common peoople,20
image40,Dr.Finch: But I had other views. Hence I faked my death and went undercover.,20
image41,Dr.Finch along with King reaches Finch's hidden lab,20
image42,Dr.Finch: As you can see here the machine gives me some random 12-digit number.,20
image43,"King: That's all fine, what do you want from me?",20
image44,Dr.Finch: Even I don't know the AI mentioned your name as part of a contingency plan. And asks me to follow you.,20
image45,"King: These are Social Security Number of peoples, date and time of the crime",20
image46,King: I can guess why the AI choose me. ,20
image47,"King: She was murdered two weeks before and the AI was right predicting it. Dr.Finch: You could have saved her, If you had this information before.",20
image48,Dr.Finch: Now I can give you an opportunity to save other lives. King: Count me in!,20
image49,Dr.Finch: The AI has given the number recently and we have to find whether he is the victim or the perputator,20
image50,King: So who is this person?!,20
image51,Dr.Finch: I have identified the person to be raymond and we have to start following him. King: How do you do this?,20
image52,Dr.Finch: The AI I built sees and hears everything through cameras and microphones.,20
image53,Dr.Finch: It tracks down the people using facial recognition through street camera and personal mobile phone feeds.,20
image54,Finch and King decide to follow raymond.,20
image55,They track Raymond activities and reach his location.,20
image56,Meanwhile Raymond meets a unknown person to get the task on what he has to do.,20
image57,They spotted Raymond and gets close to him.,20
image58,They decide to casually tail Raymond to gather more intel on his where abouts.,20
image59,They loose track of him and King senses something big is going to happen.,20
image60,Finch bugged Raymonds phone and gets the bug activated to track him.,20
image61,Raymond enters a highly secured government building through a back door.,20
image62,The AI gives the where about of Raymond and demands to consider it as high priority.,20
image63,Finch and King fakes their digital footprints and follows Raymond.,20
image64,Raymond enters a highly secured government building.,20
image65,"Dr.Finch: King there is going to be a problem, I recognise this place.",20
image66,Dr.Finch: This is where the AI is safe guarded and Raymond is trying to access it.,20
image67,King: Let's enter to see what he does,20
image68,Dr.Finch: He is the perputator. He tries to kill the AI.,20
image69,Raymond gets excited on the discovery of the machine.,20
image70,Raymond tries to access the master port to alter the AI's basic neural schema.,20
image71,The new neural schema is getting loaded. ,20
image72,Raymond starts to inject he malicious code.,20
image73,Finch and King grab him red handed and stop the neural schema upload.,20
image74,King takes Raymond at gunpoint and extracts him to a blacksite with Finch.,20
image75,King: Tell me why you want to kill the machine? Raymond: I am not trying to kill the machine. I have a big picture!,20
image76,"King: Don't act smart. Reveal the big names behind this or your die. Raymond: Hold on, I will give you the names.",20
image77,Raymond: Its Ethan Hunt and Adams. They want me to inject a code so that AI can be used for saving few Billionaires. They are planning to monitizing the AI.,20
image78,Dr.Finch: I know them. They don't want their names offically to do this and hence sent Raymond.,20
image79,Dr.Finch: They are grade A Intelligent Officers working at the top level of the US government!,20
image80,Dr.Finch: This is their office but we can't even go at its sight.,20
image81,Location: Govt headquaters - Washington DC,20
image82,Adam is frustrated as he gets some intel about the backdoor code by Finch,20
image83,Ethan schedules an appoinment to meet Adams,20
image84,Ethan: can I come in? Adams: Yes please. ,20
image85,Ethan: Ethan hunt reporting on duty!,20
image86,"Ethan: Sir, here is the success report on how well the AI machine is performing",20
image87,Adam reads the report and finds there is no information about the backdoor code,20
image88,Adam (Angry): The report is full of s*** just like you,20
image89,"Adam: See this, there is huge hole that you left unnoticed",20
image90,Ethan: We tried to fix this code but somebody is overriding it. Adam: I know who it is. It's Dr.Finch!,20
image91,"Ethan: But sir, he is dead as per our records. Adam: No he is not, I want him dead for real this time.",20
image92,Adam feels pressured as the promised deadline to provide the AI access for the billionares is nearing,20
image93,"Ethan: We have to capture the scientist and his resources, without leaving anything behind.",20
image94,"Ethan: You will find this setup in his lab. Destroy it, it shouldn't be accessible to anybody else.",20
image95,Ethan captures Dr.Finch ,20
image96,"Dr.Finch: Please don't do this, you are making a bit mistake. Ethan: This is the end of everything!",20
image97,The AI cannot see Dr.Finch movement and activates contingency plan.,20
image98,Michael King now gets a call as he is the contingency plan.,20
image99,King receives the number of Dr.Finch and searches for him.,20
image100,King is clueless on what danger Dr.Finch has gotten into,20
image101,King finds out where Dr.Finch is kept in custody,20
image102,The conman - King fights the guards and rescues Dr.Finch,20
image103,They both move to a public place to dicuss on what to be done next,20
image104,Dr.Finch: King thanks for all your help. I am going to put an end for what I have created.,20
image105,"Dr.Finch: The machine should be destroyed immediately, otherwise it could end up in the wrong hands or the AI iteslf will taken control over humans like skynet.",20
image106,King: But we can save a lot of people with the information the machine gives us. Do you want to let down all the people who can be saved?,20
image107,Dr.Finch: You don't know the power of AI. It is capable of anything.,20
image108,"King: But you are the creator of it, you can control it.",20
image109,"Finch: Probably, but a machine is just a machine. It even orders to kill me and you if it finds that we are ready to comprise it. That's how its programed.",20
image110,****Now its up to the audience to decide whether to kill the AI or to use it for greater purpose****,20
