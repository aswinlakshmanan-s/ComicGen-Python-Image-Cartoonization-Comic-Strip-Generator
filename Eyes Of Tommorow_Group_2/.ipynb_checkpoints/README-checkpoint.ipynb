    "## Cartoonize Image Using OpenCV\n",
    "\n",
    "To cartoonize an image using OpenCV, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert to Grayscale:** Convert the loaded image to grayscale. This step simplifies the image and helps in reducing noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply Median Blur:** Apply median blur to the grayscale image. Median blur helps in smoothing the image while preserving edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Detect Edges:** Use adaptive thresholding to detect edges in the image. Adaptive thresholding is a technique used to binarize images based on local pixel intensities, which helps in highlighting edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cartoonize the Image:**\n",
    "   - **Bilateral Filtering:** Apply bilateral filtering to the original color image. Bilateral filtering smooths the image while preserving edges and texture.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Bitwise AND Operation:** Perform a bitwise AND operation between the color-filtered image and the edge-detected image. This operation retains the color information from the original image while emphasizing the detected edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Save and Display the Cartoonized Image:**\n",
    "   - **Save Image:** Save the cartoonized image to a file using `cv2.imwrite()`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Display Image:** Display the cartoonized image in the Jupyter Notebook using `display(Image())`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can create a cartoonized version of any image using OpenCV.\n",

    "The provided Python code defines two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `compress_image`: This function takes an input image file path, compresses the image using the Pillow library, and saves the compressed image to the specified output path. It allows specifying the quality of the compression (0-100), where higher quality results in a larger file size.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `compress_images_in_directory`: This function iterates through all JPEG images in a specified directory and its subdirectories. It creates an output directory if it doesn't exist, then compresses each JPEG image using the `compress_image` function, saving the compressed images in the output directory. Similar to `compress_image`, it also allows specifying the quality of compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided Python function `add_dialogues_to_images` is designed to add dialogues from a CSV file to corresponding images in a specified folder. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:\n",

    "  - For each row, it loads the corresponding image using `Image.open` from the PIL library.\n",
    "  - It creates an `ImageDraw.Draw` object to draw the dialogue text on the image.\n",
    "  - Font information is set using `ImageFont.truetype`, allowing adjustments to the font size and style.\n",
    "  - The dialogue text is added to the image at a specified position, typically at the bottom.\n",
    "  - The modified image is saved to the output folder.\n",
